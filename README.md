# AWS Learning Labs

## Overview
This repository contains my hands-on work with Amazon Web Services, categorized into three main areas:

### 1. Hands-On Labs
*   Quick experiments and tutorials for specific AWS services.
*   *Examples: Creating your first S3 bucket, building a serverless API with Lambda and API Gateway.*

### 2. Learning Paths
*   Structured labs focused on specific goals, like AWS certifications or mastering a particular domain (e.g., Security, Networking).
*   *Examples: Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) labs, Advanced VPC setups.*

### 3. Production Labs
*   Complex, multi-service projects that mimic real-world production architectures.
*   *Examples: A three-tier web application with CI/CD, a data analytics pipeline with Kinesis and Redshift.*

## Getting Started
Each lab is contained in its own directory with a dedicated README for setup instructions and explanations.
